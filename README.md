# Decision Trees (ID3,C4.5)

This project is the implementation in Python of ID3 and C4.5 algorithms, that create Decision Tree to classificate great amounts of data, in a simple way and fast, using entropy and deciding the priority of the nodes.
Our algorithms are basic, they do not prune the trees, so you can see them very large (for our example database, we have arround 4000 nodes in our tree...).

This project was made for an university subject.<br>
